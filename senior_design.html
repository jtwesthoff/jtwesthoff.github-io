Electro-Pneumatic Air Shock Optimization System with User Specified Parameters and Integrated Driver Control for Off Road Vehicles - Senior Design
            </h2>
            <p>Our innovative project empowers drivers to seamlessly regulate solenoid valves on off-road vehicles while in motion. By providing real-time ground pressure data, drivers can make informed decisions about valve adjustments to optimize vehicle performance.
            With eight distinct pressure options at their fingertips, drivers navigate through states effortlessly using a combination of a switch and four buttons.
          Utilizing a Raspberry Pi as the primary interface, our system displays ground pressure, state information, and solenoid pressure to the driver, enhancing situational awareness and control.
        To ensure ease of access and operation, vital information is conveniently displayed on a screen mounted directly into the steering wheel, with buttons and switches intelligently integrated into the wheel's design.
      This ergonomic solution addresses the unique challenge of keeping the driver's hands securely fastened to the vehicle during operation.</p>
            <p>This project served as my computer science capstone for Fairfield University. This is an interdisciplinary project using a team comprised of two mechanical engineers and two computer scientists.
            The project is still under development, below is the progress so far.</p>

            <p>Our project features a SolidWorks model designed to house our Arduino unit.
          The box has strategically positioned front ports to accommodate harness connections with ease.
        To ensure optimal functionality, we've incorporated side holes for efficient fan ventilation, maintaining the Arduino's optimal operating temperature. </p>
            <p>On the opposing side, a carefully designed grate facilitates proper airflow, ensuring effective heat dissipation.
            While the box is easily adaptable for waterproofing, our current testing environment prioritizes functionality over waterproofing requirements.</p>

            <p>Our project harnesses the power of an Arduino to manage core logic, monitor pressure levels, and regulate solenoid valves with precision.
              Complementing this functionality, a Raspberry Pi serves as the interface for the driver, providing real-time state updates and pressure readings.</p>
            <p>Given the Raspberry Pi's limitation in reading analog inputs, a JSON file acts as the conduit for seamless data exchange between the two computing platforms.
              This integration ensures efficient communication and enables comprehensive monitoring and control capabilities essential for our system's operation.</p>
              <p>The system utilizes a high-capacity air compressor to store and supply air, which is then regulated by a series of solenoid valves.
                These valves are programmed to fill or empty the air shocks as needed, thereby achieving a desired pressure setting. </p>

            <p>If a change in pressure is detected then the system will automatically fill or release air to maintain the desired pressure.
              Before making any changes the system performs a check for any spikes in pressure so that no adjustments are made going over certain obstacles to ensure driver safety and vehicle durability. </p>
            <p>The results from the static suspension travel testing show that the system is more effective at achieving the desired suspension travel than the stock shocks.
              The system created an overall improvement of 77%, with 65% efficiency in the rear suspension, and 88% in the front.
              This indicates that the system will allow the vehicle to better handle the obstacles it may face in any off-road terrain.
	            The dynamic feedback of the system showed better obstacle handling, reduced chassis movement, and adaptability. </p>
